UNVT Portable Option D: Free maps are portable.

## What is UNVT POD?
The UNVT POD is a setup that includes hardware to deploy a Caddy-based web map server on a LAN with limited internet. It uses Raspberry Pi OS installed on a USB SSD and configures Martin and Caddy.

## Free maps are portable

"Free maps are portable" means web maps can work in places with little or no internet. Using devices like Raspberry Pi and software like Caddy, you can create a portable web map server. This server works on a local network, so it does not need the internet. It is helpful in remote areas, disaster response, and education where internet access is limited.
