UNVT Portable Option D: Free web maps are portable.

## What is UNVT POD?
The UNVT POD is a comprehensive setup, including hardware, designed to deploy a Caddy-based web map server on a LAN with limited internet bandwidth. This involves installing Raspberry Pi OS on a USB SSD and configuring Martin and Caddy on it.

## Free web maps are portable

The concept of "Free web maps are portable" emphasizes the ability to use web maps in environments with limited or no internet connectivity. By leveraging lightweight hardware like Raspberry Pi and software such as Caddy, users can create a portable web map server. This server can be deployed on a local network, making it accessible without relying on external internet resources. This approach is particularly useful for remote areas, disaster response, and educational purposes, where reliable internet access may not be available.
